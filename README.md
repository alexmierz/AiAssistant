# Mierzejewski Ai Assistant App
> An Ai Assistant app.

Introducing a groundbreaking AI Voice Assistant App, meticulously crafted using SwiftUI and compatible across iOS, visionOS, and macOS platforms. As of today, January 19, 2024, this app stands as an ambitious work in progress, aspiring to redefine user interaction with smart devices. At its core, the app integrates OpenAI's cutting-edge GPT-4 LLM model, enabling it to understand and respond to user queries with unprecedented accuracy and depth. Complementing this is the Whisper API, which effortlessly converts user speech into text, ensuring the app understands every word with remarkable precision. Furthermore, the app's seamless interaction loop is completed by a state-of-the-art TTS (Text-to-Speech) API, which articulates the app's responses in a clear, lifelike voice. Designed with SwiftUI, the app boasts a sleek, intuitive interface, making advanced AI interactions feel natural and accessible on any device, whether it's an iPhone, an Apple TV running visionOS, or a Mac. While not fully functional yet, this AI Voice Assistant App is not just a tool but a next-gen companion, poised to assist, engage, and connect with users in a more intelligent, responsive, and personal way than ever before, once its development and refinement reach completion.
